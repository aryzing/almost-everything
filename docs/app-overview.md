# Dashboard

The _dashboard_ is the main view of the application. From the dashboard, the user can understand the state of the _recruitment process_.

The _recruitment process_ is the series of stages candidates traverse before becoming employed. The process consists of three stages: _applied_, _interviewing_, and _hired_. Currently these are the only stages defined, which leaves the behavior of "dropping out" undefined, and therefore not implemented.

The candidates can be moved freely across all three stages. Although in real life, once a candidate is hired, they can't go back to the interviewing stage, this is possible to do in the dashboard to account for mistakes by the user when moving candidates.
