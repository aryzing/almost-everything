# Dashboard

The _dashboard_ is the main view of the application. From the dashboard, the user can understand the state of the _recruitment process_.

The _recruitment process_ is the series of stages candidates traverse before becoming employed. The process consists of three stages: _applied_, _interviewing_, and _hired_. Currently these are the only stages defined, which leaves the behavior of "dropping out" undefined, and therefore not implemented.
